# üí¨ Scalable Real-Time Chat System

## üß† Overview
This project is a **scalable real-time chat system** built with **NestJS**, **GraphQL**, **Kafka**, **Redis**, and **PostgreSQL**, featuring multi-instance support via **Traefik** and containerized using **Docker Compose**.

The system demonstrates distributed message delivery, persistence, and real-time synchronization across multiple backend instances.

---

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Components
- **User Service** ‚Äî manages user creation and retrieval.
- **Chat Service** ‚Äî manages chat rooms, message storage, and real-time delivery.
- **Frontend (React)** ‚Äî communicates with both services through GraphQL API.
- **Kafka** ‚Äî asynchronous message broker ensuring reliable delivery and scalability.
- **Redis (Pub/Sub)** ‚Äî enables real-time subscriptions via GraphQL.
- **PostgreSQL** ‚Äî stores all persistent entities (users, rooms, messages).
- **Traefik** ‚Äî reverse proxy for routing, load balancing, and real-time monitoring via Traefik Dashboard.

### Flow
1. User sends message via GraphQL mutation.
2. Chat service stores message in PostgreSQL.
3. Message is pushed to Kafka topic.
4. Kafka consumer broadcasts message through Redis Pub/Sub.
5. Clients subscribed to the corresponding chat room instantly receive the update.

This architecture allows **scalable horizontal growth** by simply adding new instances behind Traefik.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack

**Backend**: NestJS, GraphQL, TypeORM, Kafka, Redis, PostgreSQL  
**Frontend**: React, Apollo Client  
**Infrastructure**: Docker, Docker Compose, Traefik, Nx Monorepo

## üßë‚Äçüíª Local Development

This project uses **Nx monorepo** to manage multiple services and shared libraries.  
Each service (User, Chat, Shared, Frontend) can be run individually or together via Nx commands.

### Run all services locally
```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Run all services in dev mode
npx nx run dev
```
This will start all backend and frontend services in parallel with live reload.

### Run specific service
```bash
# Run only User Service
npx nx serve user-service

# Build only shared libs
npx nx build @chromaspace/shared
```

### Environment Variables
- **Frontend** uses `.env.local` for local development and `.env.docker` for Docker runtime.  
- All other services (User, Chat, Shared) also read from `.env.local` during development.
- Each service supports hot reload with `nx serve`.

**Example `.env.local` for all services you can find in env.template file**

For Docker builds, `.env.docker` is automatically injected at build time.  
This separation allows consistent local vs. containerized environments.

### Multi-Instance Mode
In the Docker setup, you can scale services dynamically by editing replicas field
All instances are automatically load-balanced by **Traefik**, which also provides a visual dashboard to monitor:
- Active containers
- Routing rules and health checks
- Real-time traffic distribution

Access Traefik dashboard:
```
http://localhost:8086
```
All service replicas run behind the same hostname/port but are distributed via Traefik‚Äôs internal load balancer.

## üê≥ Running with Docker

### Prerequisites
- Docker & Docker Compose installed
- Ports `80`, `5432`, `9092`, `6379` available

### Run Locally via Docker
```bash
# 1. Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/IllyaAvramenko/chromaspace
cd scalable-chat

# 2. Install dependencies for all services
npm install --workspaces

# 3. Build and start all containers
docker-compose up --build
```
System will automatically start multiple instances of backend services and route them through Traefik.

Access points:
- **Frontend** ‚Üí http://localhost:8085
- **Kafka** ‚Üí localhost:9092
- **Redis** ‚Üí localhost:6379
- **Postgres** ‚Üí localhost:5432
- **Traefik Dashboard** ‚Üí http://localhost:8086

## üß© Architecture Evaluation and Improvement Roadmap

### üîç Current Architecture

Stack:
- **NestJS + GraphQL + TypeORM** as API core
- **Redis Pub/Sub** for instant subscriptions
- **Kafka** for event-driven reliability
- **PostgreSQL** as primary data store
- **Docker Compose + Traefik** for multi-instance setup

üß† Event Flow:
1. `sendMessage` mutation stores data in DB and sends event to Kafka.
2. Kafka consumer reads event and publishes it to Redis.
3. Redis triggers GraphQL subscription ‚Üí client receives message instantly.

Redis ensures **low latency (<10ms)**, Kafka provides **durable delivery**, PostgreSQL guarantees **persistence**.

### üßÆ Evaluation
| Criterion | Score | Comment |
|------------|--------|----------|
| **Architecture clarity** | 8/10 | Clear separation between Kafka, Redis, and GraphQL layers. |
| **Scalability** | 7/10 | Redis Pub/Sub limits scaling beyond one cluster without sharding. |
| **Reliability** | 8/10 | Kafka ensures message durability. |
| **Performance** | 9/10 | Real-time response and fast delivery. |
| **Maintainability** | 7/10 | Needs clearer configuration and bootstrap refactor. |
| **Security** | 6/10 | Missing authentication and message encryption. |

Estimated load capacity: **10k‚Äì50k concurrent users** with current setup.

### üöÄ Improvement Directions

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Infrastructure
- Optimize Docker builds (multi-stage, no dependency on pre-installed node_modules)
- Reduce image size (use `node:alpine`)
- Add health checks and restart policies
- Automate deployment (GitHub Actions, k8s, or Swarm)
- Add **Traefik monitoring** for performance metrics and routing health visualization.

#### üß† Architecture
- Replace Pub/Sub with **Redis Streams** for persistence and replay
- Introduce a **Broker Abstraction Layer** for switching Kafka/NATS/Redis
- Cache message history in Redis with TTL
- Split ChatService into microservices for scalability

#### üîê Security
- Add **JWT/OAuth2** authentication with refresh tokens
- Implement **2FA** and **E2E encryption**

#### üí¨ UX Features
- Add user status (online/offline/typing)
- File and image sharing (via S3/MinIO)
- Edit/delete messages, add reactions, notifications

#### üìà Scalability
- Kafka partitioning by chat rooms
- Redis Cluster mode
- WebSocket Gateway for scaling (similar to Discord)
- Observability (Prometheus, Grafana, OpenTelemetry)

#### üß± Environment & Build Management
- Unify `.env.local`, `.env.docker`, `.env.production` handling
- Automate environment injection per target (backend/frontend)
- Use Nx to manage consistent build pipelines and versioning

#### üß™ Testing
- Add **unit tests** for message, user, and room services using Jest.
- Add **integration tests** for Kafka ‚Üí Redis ‚Üí GraphQL flow.
- Add **end-to-end tests** for message sending and receiving via frontend (Cypress or Playwright).
- Implement **CI pipeline** to automatically run test suites on every PR.

### üß≠ Summary
This system is a strong **MVP-to-Production bridge**. With Redis Streams + Kafka optimization and proper gateway design, it can scale to:
- **50,000 active users** (current setup)
- **200,000+ users** (clustered Kafka & Redis)
- **1M+ users** (gateway + sharding + optimized infra)
